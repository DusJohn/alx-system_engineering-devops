My first readme for 0x00-shell_basics. The fourteen scripts in this directory  prints the absolute path name of the current working directory, displays a list of the content in the current directory, changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory, displays the content of the current directory in a long format, displays the content of the current directory including hidden files in long format, displays the content of the current directory including hidden files, with user and group IDs displayed numerically and in long format too, creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory, Move the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory, deletes the file betty from /tmp/my_first_directory, deletes the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory, changes the working directory to the previous one,  lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format, prints the type of the file named iamafile which will be in the /tmp directory when the script is run, creates a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__ which will be created in the current working directory, and  copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory, respectively.
